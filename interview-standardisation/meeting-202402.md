### Comments
1. [CK] Earlier tech challenge could be solved by ChatGPT/GPT-4. Solution needs to be ChatGPT-resistant. F2F runthrough is important.
2. [CK] Rubrics are *not easy* and *not easily generalisable*. The example presented is Java-centric. Need different rubrics for different tech stack.
3. [CK] Maintenance is just as difficult as creating the rubrics. We need to constantly monitor and adjust in order to keep it relevant and usable.
4. [CK] Need feedback from larger group to develop and maintain it.
5. [CK] Designed with GTCF (Competency Framework) in mind, but only targeted at specfiic competencies. When interviewing candidate, they first need to establish the level and competency they want to assess in order to come up with the right questions for the candidate. 

## Question Bank

1. [Oscar] Being studied but no action taken yet.
2. [Oscar] In addition to ChatGPT, also need to be resistant against people sharing with their friends.
3. [Oscar] Need "small" questions - questions that cannot be Googled.

## Cheng Yong's Sharing
1. Similar to interview format from Bo and Chee Kean.
2. Questions should match candidateâ€™s experience.
3. For system design. Password reset form is good question - open ended. Can be good for both senior and junior
4. Different rubrics during different parts of the interview - similar to Chee Kean's different set of rubris.

## Discussions

1. [Oscar] Interview bias is important problem to address.
2, [Oscar] Hiring panel should be different from hiring team for consistency and reduce bias.
3. [Oscar] We need to have proper training/workshop for interviewers.
4. [Calvin] Original thought was to start by standardising on interview format, latest thought is to focus on dividing the interview into modules, and focus on modules one by one.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

1. Monthly meeting to update progress and seek feedback and help.
2. Calvin, Bo, and Chee Kean would be liasing with POD (Yanting and Hui Yun), and working with them on implementation. We may need help and support, but it is preliminary to determine activities.
3. We start by taking the interview format and break down into parts and examine each individually.
