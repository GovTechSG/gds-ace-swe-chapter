### 2022

#### Rationalisation of Frontend & Backend Engineering Competencies with DSAI

Context

- Started in Sept 2022 when given the guidance to identify commonalities and rationalise similar competencies amongst different functional clusters.
- DSAI's Frontend & Backend Programming might be similar to Apps Dev SWE's Frontend Engineering and Backend Engineering.
- Jie Sheng from ACE and Weiguang from DSAID begin working on the rationalisation.

Approach

- Similarties and differences are identified.
- DSAI's Frontend Engineering competency include data visualisation and charting descriptors.
- DSAI's Backend Engineering competency include data pipelining.
- The agreed approach is to include data science descriptors to the current Apps Dev competencies.
- Assessment criteria will be defined by both parties so that there will be a common yardstick to assess staff in both DSAID and Apps Dev.

Endorsed

- Weiguang presented to CDMC on 06 Feb 2023 and was approved in the same meeting.
- Incorporated additional descriptors to the current Apps Dev Frontend Engineering and Backend Engineering competencies, to include DSAI requirements.
- For DSAI-specific and GDS-specific projects/nuances, it will be contextualised in the assessment critieria.
- Rationalised competencies will be owned by Apps Dev, with Alvina (DSAI) as the Co-Chapter Lead for Software Engineer job role, assessing DSAI officers.
- Co-Chapter Leads will align in terms of the assessment criteria and assessment of staff, across GDS and DSAI to ensure porosity.
