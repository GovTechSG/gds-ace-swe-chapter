## Assessment Procedure

1. This is carried for each of the two semi-annual assessment cycles - June and December. The mid-year cycle is only for new hires.
2. Our scope is only for the 6 SWE competencies. We do not cover LCF (Leadership Competency Framework) or competencies for other job roles.
3. SWE Chapter only reviews L3 and above. L1 and L2 are endorsed by respective ROs only.
4. For successful L3 assessments, we currently do not review them once employee has been endorsed for L3. However, this may change in the future.
5. Successful L4 and L5 assessments need to be reviewed every 2 years.

| **Assessment** | **Supporting Documents** | **Accessor** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 to L2 | Employee and RO provide justification. | RO |

### Procedure

1. List of review candidates are distributed among SWE Chapter co-leads to make first pass.
 1. Ensure RO and employee provide clear and complete supporting documentation.
 2. Optional: Interview either RO and/or employee for clarification.
3. SWE Chatper co-leads then come together in a panel to review recommendation. We should be able to conclude by then, except in exceptional cases where further deliberation and interview maybe needed.
